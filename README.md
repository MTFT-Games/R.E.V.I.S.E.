# This repo does not contain anything other than this short description for now due to being busy with schoolwork at the moment.
This repo will soon contain the arduino code, assembly description and instructions, images, and demos once I have time to add these and more when the project is finished (hopefully very soon)

REVISE is an arduino/pn532 project built as a replacement for the key switch in my car. 
Instead of using the original key, it allows me to use the RFID chip implanted in my hand to unlock and start my vehicle with the pn532 RFID reader mounted under the windshield.
